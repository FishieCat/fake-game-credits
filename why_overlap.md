# Why should credit roll screenshots overlap?

Let's assume someone submits credits proof as screenshots and uploads the following two images

Looks like Guillermo García is the first programmer, doesn't it? Well, we can't tell from just looking at these screenshots. What if content was skipped by accident?

If a video link is included, the approver now has to go check the video.

If no video link is included, the approver would have to find a video of the credits. If none exists, they woud need to get hold of the game, hopefully being able to view credits from the menu.

If we check the [fake example](https://fishiecat.github.io/fake-game-credits/) used as a basis here, we see that all programmers were skipped and now artists are getting credited as programmers.

This is why you should record videos instead of taking screenshots of credit rolls (to then take controlled screenshots of the video using the video player's screenshot feature).

And this is why you should take overlapping screenshots like this:

Or even better — just in case there are two "Programming" roles for some reason — like this:
